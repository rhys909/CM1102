          Shawn Fanning was born in Brockton, Massachusetts on 22<sup>nd</sup> November 1980.
          He was also the main developer of Napster which was one
          of the first peer-to-peer file sharing platforms. After Napster's
          shutdown in 2001, Shawn then found himself joining and investing in
          a number of tech startups such as Snocap, Rupturs, Path and Airtime.
          He even reunited with Sean Parker to develop Airtime.com which
          ultimately failed due to significant investment into promotion
          and celebrities appearing to the opening party, as opposed to
          actually investing in the technology working.

          Sean Parker was born in Herdon, Virginia on 3<sup>rd</sup> December 1979.
          He is an entrepreneur and philanthropist who has been involved with many
          large organisations such as Napster, Facebook and Spotify. He also joined
          back with Napster colleague Shawn Fanning for Airtime.com which failed.<br>
          In June 2015 Sean Parker announced that he was going to launch the Parker
          Foundation which has three areas of intrest: Life Sciences, Global Public
          Health and Civic Engagement. To this he invested $600 million (≈£400million).
          In April 2016, he also donated $250 million to start the Parker Institute for
          Cancer Immunotherapy.
