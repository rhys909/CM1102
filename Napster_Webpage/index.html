      <p> This webpage is all about the initial release Napster, which was a music
          sharing service that recieved alot of backlash namely from Metallica and
          Dr Dre. Napster at its release was however a revolutionary peer to peer file
          sharing service that accentuated the sharing of audio files, typically in
          the MP3 file format. However as it grew in popularity and became widely used
          Napster ran into legal troubles.
      </p>
      <p> Napster was founded by Shawn Fanning and Sean Parker, the original software opperated for
          2 years from 1999 to 2001, before it was shut down following legal battles and copyright
          infringement. Although it was shut down the Napster brand name continued and was bought in
          2002 by the German media group <strong><a href="https://www.bertelsmann.com/#st-1">Bertelsmann</a></strong>.
